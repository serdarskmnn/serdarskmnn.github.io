# Avionics & Autonomous Systems Engineer

> *"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."* — Napoleon Bonaparte

Hi, I'm **Serdar Sökmen**. I am an Electrical-Electronics Engineering student and UAV Pilot dedicated to designing the next generation of autonomous flight systems. My work bridges the gap between theoretical control systems and real-world embedded applications.

## 🏆 Featured Project: METU VTOL 2025
**Role:** Team Leader & Avionics Leader and Flight Control Algorithm Designer

Our team designed a **Tilt-Rotor VTOL UAV** capable of vertical takeoff and efficient forward flight. This project was selected as a **Finalist** in the prestigious METU VTOL Aircraft Competition 2025.

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **Custom Flight Controller:** Developed using STM32 and C++.
* **Simulation:** Validated aerodynamics and transition logic in MATLAB/Simulink & Gazebo.
* **Autonomy:** Implemented mission planning and fail-safe protocols using ArduPilot.

## 🧠 Simulation Lab
My personal R&D playground for testing advanced control theories before deployment.

### 1. 🚁 6-DOF Flight Control & Visual Servoing
A complete simulation environment where a drone autonomously tracks and follows a moving target using a downward-facing camera.
* **Tech:** MATLAB, Simulink, Computer Vision.
* **Result:** Successful tracking with real-time PID adjustments.

### 2. ⚡ Hybrid Power Management System (HAK)
A critical safety system designed to switch power sources from Hydrogen Fuel Cell to Li-Po battery in under 5ms during failure.
* **Tech:** Simscape Electrical, Stateflow.
* **Result:** Verified seamless transition with zero voltage drop.
