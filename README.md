## 🏆 Featured Project: METU VTOL 2025
**Role:** Avionics Lead & Flight Control Algorithm Designer

Our team designed a **Tilt-Rotor VTOL UAV** capable of vertical takeoff and efficient forward flight. This project was selected as a **Finalist** in the prestigious METU VTOL Aircraft Competition 2025.

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **Custom Flight Controller:** Developed using STM32 and C++.
* **Simulation:** Validated aerodynamics and transition logic in MATLAB/Simulink & Gazebo.
* **Autonomy:** Implemented mission planning and fail-safe protocols using ArduPilot.
